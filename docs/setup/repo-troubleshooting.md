# Repository Setup Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up the repository on macOS using the provided script, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

## 1. Homebrew Installation Issues

If the script fails to install Homebrew or reports any issues related to Homebrew, try the following steps:

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection and can access the Homebrew servers.
- Check if you have the necessary permissions to install Homebrew on your system.
- Visit the Homebrew website (<https://brew.sh>) and follow their manual installation instructions if the script continues to fail.

## 2. GitHub CLI (gh) Installation Issues

If the GitHub CLI installation fails or throws errors, consider these actions:

- Verify that Homebrew is installed correctly by running `brew --version`.
- Ensure you have the required permissions to install packages via Homebrew.
- Check the GitHub CLI formula on Homebrew's GitHub repository (<https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core>) for any reported issues or updates.

## 3. Pyenv Installation Issues

When facing problems with Pyenv installation, try the following:

- Make sure Homebrew is functioning correctly and that you can install packages through it.
- Check if any conflicting Python-related tools are installed on your system.
- Review the official Pyenv documentation (<https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>) for any troubleshooting information.

## 4. Python Dependency Installation Issues

In case specific Python dependencies fail to install using Homebrew, you can attempt the following:

- Ensure your Homebrew installation is up-to-date (`brew update`) and try installing the dependencies again.
- Check the formulae for the failed dependencies on Homebrew's GitHub repository for any reported issues or workarounds.

## 5. Script Execution and Permissions

If the script itself encounters issues or fails to execute, consider these steps:

- Confirm that you have the necessary permissions to execute the script (`chmod +x scriptname.sh`).
- Double-check the script for any syntax errors or typos.
- Review the script's logic to understand how it handles various scenarios.

Remember, running scripts that make system-level changes can have significant consequences, so always proceed with caution and take necessary precautions to ensure the script's source is trustworthy.

**Note:** The information provided here is not exhaustive, and specific troubleshooting steps may vary depending on your system configuration and any changes made to the original script.

If you still face problems or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help from experienced users or the community to resolve the issues and successfully set up your system for GPT usage.
